# Examportal-Project
Examportal is a dynamic online portal that provides a seamless platform for users to take exams in various categories. It is designed with a modern and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to navigate and interact with the system. The portal features login/logout and user registration functionalities to ensure secure access to the exams and personalized user experience.

The front-end of Examportal is built using Angular, a popular and powerful web application framework, which provides a rich and responsive user interface. The Angular components are designed to be modular and reusable, allowing for efficient development and maintenance of the portal. The user interface is designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly, providing a smooth and enjoyable experience for users while taking exams.

The back-end of Examportal is developed using Spring Boot, a robust and scalable Java-based framework, which provides the necessary tools and functionalities for building a secure and high-performance web application. The back-end handles user authentication and authorization, exam management, and result processing. It also integrates with a database to store exam questions, user information, and exam results.

Examportal supports user registration, allowing users to create accounts and log in securely. Once logged in, users can select from a variety of exam categories, such as mathematics, science, history, and more. They can take exams in their chosen category, which are dynamically generated from the database and presented in a timed and interactive format. Users can submit their answers, and the system automatically evaluates and scores the exams. The exam results are stored securely in the database and can be viewed by the users.

The Examportal project is a solo effort, demonstrating strong technical skills and proficiency in Angular and Spring Boot. It showcases the ability to design and develop a dynamic online portal with modern features, such as user registration, login/logout, exam management, and result processing. The project is built following best practices for software development, including code reusability, modularity, and security, ensuring a robust and scalable solution for online exams in various categories.
